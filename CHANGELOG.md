## 1.2.4 (2022-04-14)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-132307a032acf5aab67e33cfe7c632e01860e376/> assure cyclic symlinks in package won't break it.
   For now we just ignore any IO error due to limitations in error
   granularity, which might mean that the package size is a little off.
   
   That's preferable over not working at all.

  crate package size exceeds the given value. This is particularly useful on CI, which can
  leverage the pre-built binaries to get quick access to `cargo diet` without building it
  from source.
