### What's newâ€¦

#### v1.1.1

* Reduce file-size of produced binaries

#### v1.1.0

* Add the --package-size-limit flag to allow exiting with a non-zero code if the estimated
  crate package size exceeds the given value. This is particularly useful on CI, which can
  leverage the pre-built binaries to get quick access to `cargo diet` without building it
  from source.

#### v1.0.0
